# Designing-and-Analysis-of-Algorithms
As we know an algorithm is a sequence of steps to solve a problem. Design and Analysis of Algorithm is vitally crucial for designing algorithm to solve different types of problems in the branch of computer science and information technology. Here I will share my knowledge from basic concepts to advanced approachs with mathematical analysis. It can be a bit difficult to get the main idea first time, therefore I will write some comments in order to explain what is going on under the hood and also to let you all understand how mathematics can be applied in computer science. 
Consider that you should have robust mathematical and logical analysis skills and as well as fundamental programming knowledge. Design and analysis is an advanced level process therefore be sure that your knowledge is appropriate to start this step

Good luck for everyone. Let's begin
